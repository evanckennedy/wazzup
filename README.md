## To do
- (front end + back end) set min password length to 6 characters or something
- (front end) display messages when you click on on a chat item
- test the schema by using sample messages and contact data to see if it works as expected.
- (once it's no longer required) remove the debugging console logs in validation.js, LoginForm.jsx, and RegisterForm.jsx
