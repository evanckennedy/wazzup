## To do
- Currently, a user who was added to a new chat has to refresh the page to see the new chat appear, but I want to make it so that, in real time, someone creates a chat, those who were added in the chat have the new chat item added to their chat list.
- (once it's no longer required) remove the debugging console logs in validation.js, LoginForm.jsx, and RegisterForm.jsx, and elsewhere
